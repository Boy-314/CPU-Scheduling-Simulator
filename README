1. How to run the program?
	a.	Before compiling and running please have the scheduler exe in the same directory as any input file that will be utilized.
	b.	There are TWO possible arguments to pass into the program:
	    1. <input-filename>
	    2. --verbose <input-filename>
	e.	The program should run successfully and display the output on the terminal.

What is verbose mode?
    - When verbose mode is activated, it will display all of the cycles involved
    in a particular algorithm. Please use this only if you want to scan the long
    lines of cycles. This is especially useful when debugging the program.

Thank you for using this scheduling algorithm.
